                    <p>The main idea of the honey pot is pretty simple, we create a Docker container that expose a service to the network, then we should have something capable of getting information from the container.</p>
                    <p>This is where the search begins, traditionally, in Linux </p>
                    <p>system the audit subsystem is the way of getting trace info from the kernel not related directly to performance,</p>
                    <p>the audit subsystem enables an interface where the client could check which syscalls have been called and information </p>
                    <p>regarding the processes that called it. Audit kernel interface is stable it was added on 2.6 kernels. </p>
                    <p>My initial tests were using auditd as a method of extracting info, </p>
                    <p>my first question was then how to collect or retrieve info from </p>
                    auditd, auditd writes in a log file, parsing the log and then sending parsed events elsewhere was an option but it seemed really fragile. </p>
                    <p> to auditd versions, and also disk input/output. Happily auditd also exposes audit information through </p>
                    netlink sockets (Netlink socket family is a Linux kernel interface used for inter-process communication (IPC) between both the kernel and userspace processes, </p>
                    <p> and between different userspace processes, in a way similar to the Unix </p>
                    domain sockets.) so it should be possible to connect in userland to that socket, process the events and then write them elsewhere. </p>
                    <p> I tried several libraries in several languages that aimed to fulfill this purpose like Slack's go-audit </p>
                    <p> Mozilla's audit-go, like gnlpy and also atraces project from Roi and Albert Puigsech sitting around here. </p>
                    <p> No matter which project i've tried it seemed that netlink interface was far from stable, when it was working suddenly events </p>
                    stopped to arrive or the format of the events was different depending of source. </p>
                    <p> Besides all these problems, auditd still doesn't have cgroups and namespaces support which means that getting container info would have been really hard. </p>
                    <p> These two things made me drop auditd as a tracing tool. Links: https://lwn.net/Articles/699819/ https://github.com/slackhq/go-audit https://github.com/mozilla/audit-go https://github.com/facebook/gnlpy </p>

                    Getting information externally from kernel was hard or unstable. At this point i've decided that instead of using established kernel interfaces i would need something inside the kernel capable of getting events, process them and output them. This is not
                    impossible but is not a trivial task. Luckily i knew about sysdig. Sysdig is an open source product that does precisely this, it loads a kernel module, and output events using lua for processing. Getting events was a solved part of
                    the problem, i also needed some kind of alert or notification when the container was compromised, once i get events captured i started to code something to generate notifications when some events matches some expressions. When i was
                    at the 30% of the project and had something working, sysdig launched falco that does precisely this. It was a relief and also sad.

                <aside class="notes">
                    So this is finally the architecture i ended with, sysdig saves in disk all the events related to the container while falco listen for "changes" when a rule is triggered like when someone launchs a shell inside the SSH. Container recycler is an small Go
                    application that listens for falco notification and when received an alert it will give some exposure time for the attacker to interact with pot, and after this time it will destroy that container and create a new one.

                    grsecurity/PaX is a set of patches for linux kernel that aims to fix or harden some vulnerabilities of the linux kernel and provides mandatory access control mechanisms through roles. I've used this in the past and offers some tooling patches not available
                    through other methods at the cost of performance or compatibility issues, due to licensing / commercial issues grsecurity does not publish patches anymore. when i started the project grsecurity still published patches for testing kernels,
                    that is not the case anymore, and at that time patching the kernel and make it work in a VPS was a non trivial task. KSPP is a movement to integrate grsecurity/PaX patches in a more palatable way for kernel maintainers so they are
                    merged in upstream kernel. At the time of this demo they have not merged almost anything yet. So it's promising but not available. AppArmor is a Linux Security Module coming from SuSE, the main selling point of AppArmor it's that is
                    not SELinux. SELinux is the traditional way to harden or secure a linux distro, its quite complete but one of the things it doesn't fit well with me is that the support for Debian is almost non-existent. seccomp is a syscall that limits
                    the subsequent syscalls of the current process could be called, that way a process can drop access to the syscalls it does not require. Docker support seccomp profiles for containers which is convenient to limit the syscalls a container
                    could access, this in addition of capabilities and/or apparmor profiles could restrict much better the amount of privileges an specific container would need, even that some containers by its application will require a fair amount of
                    privileges. The plan is to use AppArmor and seccomp profiles to reduce the attack surface, however there always be the case where an exploit could be found, and attacker gains privileges. So my plan for it in addition of this security
                    measures and also for getting much intel is to renew the probes, from time to time destroy them and create new ones.
